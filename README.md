## Character Designer Tool - UnityEditor Scripting Project

**Character Designer Tool** is my first project using Unity Editor Scripting.
It is a tool that simulates the character creation in the game Destiny 2, by Bungie. The proposal is to help the developers to create Guardians (main characters) more quickly with all necessary attributes currently in the game.

This **𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐥** allowed me to dive into the following concepts:
- Scriptable Objects
- UnityEditor classes (EditorGUILayout, AssetDatabase etc)
